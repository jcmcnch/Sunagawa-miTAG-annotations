# Sunagawa-miTAG-annotations

The taxonomic affiliations for the miTAGS contained in the Sunagawa et al (2015) dataset (http://ocean-microbiome.embl.de/companion.html) are difficult to interpret ecologically. The full taxonomy strings are too long to easily understand at a glance, and parsing by taxonomic level is not a good option since taxa vary widely in the depth of their annotations. For example, cyanobacteria should be annotated at the genus level or higher but many other abundant but less described taxa do not have any taxonomic information at that level. To overcome this, I've done some manual curation to provide a short taxonomic identifier that can be used to provide an indicator of the rough ecological niche of an organism while remaining short enough to be interpreted at a glance.
